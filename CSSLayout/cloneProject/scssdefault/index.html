          An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
          horror.

        <div class="sidebar__smalltext">
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror, and all
          have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

          This one’s another one for the completist horror fan. It’s not a bad
          film by any means. It’s actually pretty great, and quite terrifying.
          It’s just… very bleak, with nothing much to wash it down with.
          Director Pascal Laugier has gotten a lot of guff for this film over
          the years, including from the two lead actresses. He even went so far
          as to open the DVD presentation of Martyrs with an apology to its
          viewers. Laugier wants you to know that he’s sorry for what he has
          committed to film. He shouldn’t be sorry. He created what’s become an
          important film in the New French Extremity movement, and those are
          some great films to be associated with.
